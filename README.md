# SHA-256 in python with arrays of ints

SHA-256 implemented in python using arrays of integers representing individual bits [1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0]<br/>
When implemented with bitwise operations, SHA-256 is difficult to visualize and alter <br/>
The purpose of this project was to implement SHA-256 in a way that allows people to actually interact with it <br/>
This project uses an integer in an array for each individual bit, allowing all the data and logic to be clearly seen

## Getting Started
There are 2 files:<br/>
SHA-256.py takes a formatted input (array of length 512, containing only 1 and 0), which should be sufficient for cryptocurrency applications.<br/>
SHA-256-LARGE.py takes a string input and runs a compression loop on it before parsing, like normal SHA-256.

### Prerequisites

There are no dependencies. It works on windows.<br/>

## Built With

notepad and powershell ðŸ˜Ž <br/>
I'm not kidding. Thanks University for teaching me good habits

## Contributing

It's basically done, if you want to help feel free to push whatever
